For the islands to continue to preserve their nature, the number of visitors is limited and you have to pay an environmental preservation fee to enter the island.

Its beaches are divided between the inside sea (waters toward the Brazilian mainland) and the outside sea (waters toward the Atlantic Ocean). It is very common to see these waters in the lists of the most beautiful beaches of Brazil and the world, such as the beaches Praia dos Porcos, Praia dos Leões, and Baía do Sancho, twice elected the best beach of the planet by the Traveller’s Choice Awards of <a href="https://www.tripadvisor.com/">TripAdvisor</a> .</h2>

                    With 450 year of history, Rio boasts fascinating treasures in its museums with enviable collection. The land of carnival and samba, and of several theaters, music venues, commercial and gastronomic locations open during the whole year.

                    But it is the match of the geography of the area – the sea, mountains and forests – along with the human presence that makes Rio de Janeiro a unique city. Extraordinary scener-ies surround many places in the city. It was the first city in the world to be considered UNESCO’s Cultural Heritage of Humanity.

                    Recently, in 2007, Valongo Wharft was also considered UNESCO’s Cultural Heritage of Humanity. Built in 1811, it was the landing place and trade area of enslaved Africans until 1831.

                    Besides the most famous attractions, like Christ the Redeemer, the art deco statue of Jesus Christ and the Sugarloaf Mountain, a mountain range, the city has also many nature, adventure, religious, historic and cultural tours, such as walks in the Botanical Garden and rides in the Santa Teresa Tram, visitations to the Metropolitan Cathedral and to the Museum of Modern Art, and the possibility of taking off from Pedra Bonita’s ramp and flying over the city.</h2>
